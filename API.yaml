# This document contains the API specification for the K7 JavaScript environment.
# The environments conforms to a naming convention based on the existing
# conventions used in ECMAScript, which are based on the Java naming conventions.
#
# Here is how K7 elements should be named:
#
# - modules:    lowercase, dot-separated ("system","system.posix")
# - constants:  UPPERCASE ("VERSION")
# - globals:    CamelCase ("SystemPath","LoadedModules")
# - functions:  camelCase ("print", "loadModule")
# - arguments:  camelCase ("parameter", "anotherParameter")
# - properties: camelCase ("length","sortedElements")
# - classes:    CamelCase ("Array","SortedArray")
# - methods:    camelCase ("Array.length", "SortedArray.sortBy")
#
# When writing new modules, they should fit in the following tree of modules.
